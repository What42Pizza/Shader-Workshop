What42's Shader License 1.7
Effective Date: 2023-12-30

By using the contents packaged with this license in any way, you agree to the terms and conditions listed in this file.



Overview: (very informal)

You can:
- Use this for Minecraft gameplay
- Use this for creating screenshots, YouTube videos, etc.
- Use this in modpacks (with restrictions)
- Create private modifications (without any restrictions)
- Create public modifications (with restrictions)
- Use parts of this shader in other shaders (with restrictions)
- Make and publish forks of this shader (with restrictions)
- Use parts of this shader in other projects (with restrictions)
- Copy parts / all of this license (without any restrictions)

You cannot:
- Claim to be the sole creator of this shader (without any exceptions)
- Redistribute this shader (with exceptions)
- Redistribute parts of this shader (with exceptions)
- Create shortened / indirect links to this shader (without any exceptions)

Notes:
- Making changes to the code isn't required for publishing altered versions of this shader; a significant enough change to the settings is enough to count (look at 2.4.3 / 2.5.3)
- Modpacks that include this shader can also include custom shaderpack settings
- The rules in the license of a fork don't apply to the creators and/or owners of said fork, though the licenses of the base shader(s) do still take effect.
- When you create a fork of this shader, you only have to follow the license of the specific version that you forked
- This license can apply to distributions of this shader (downloaded from curseforge, modrinth, etc) and apply separately to a download of this shader's repo. That means the images, Rust code, and everything else in this shader's full repo is protected by this license.
- If you're sure that what you're doing is allowed by this license, there's no need to ask for permission

No one person holds the copyright for all of the contents of this shader. Full credits can be found in the file 'readme.md'.
If you feel that your copyrights have been violated, please contact all parties involved to have your work removed.
The creator of What42's Shader Base goes by "What42" / "What42Pizza" online, and you can contact him on Discord at "What42Pizza#0283" or by email at "burg.what42@gmail.com".
