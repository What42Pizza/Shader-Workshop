Before you report:
1: Make sure you're using the latest Shaderpack version and the latest Iris / OptiFine.
2: Check if the problem has already been reported here or Iris's / OptiFine's issue trackers
3: (Bonus) Imagine I respond really harshly with something like "Dude how on earth did you forget ___??", and think to yourself, 'what would that blank be?'. This may not be applicable to your situation, but if this stops you from making yourself look like an absolute idiot, you'll be really thankful



**Describe the bug**
What is wrong, and what is supposed to happen instead? Screenshots can be pretty helpful here

**To Reproduce**
When does this occur?

**Context**
Must-include information: F3 screenshot, Minecraft version, Iris / OptiFine version, OS, and basic computer specs

Keep in mind that this is a template, and you can put extra information wherever you want
